# What is the difference between DevOps and DevSecOps?

## Introduction
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in DevOps and DevSecOps, which are two approaches to software development and delivery. While they share some similarities, they also have distinct differences that are important to understand. In this article, we will explore what DevOps and DevSecOps are, and how they differ from each other.

## DevOps
- DevOps is an approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration, communication, and automation between software developers and IT operations teams. 
- It aims to streamline the software development process and improve the speed and quality of software delivery. 
- DevOps focuses on continuous integration and delivery, which means that software is tested and deployed as soon as it is ready.

### Example
- Developers and operations team work together to deploy the code to the production environment.
- Continuous integration is a part of DevOps, which means that developers push their code changes to a common repository multiple times a day.
- Continuous deployment is also a part of DevOps, which means that changes made in the code are automatically deployed to the production environment.

## DevSecOps
- DevSecOps is an extension of the DevOps approach that incorporates security into the software development process. 
- It aims to ensure that security is not an afterthought, but rather a key part of the development process from the very beginning. 
- DevSecOps involves integrating security practices and tools into the DevOps process, such as vulnerability scanning, threat modeling, and security testing.

### Example
- In DevSecOps, security is integrated into the entire software development process from the planning stage to the deployment stage.
- The developers and security team work together to identify potential security issues in the code and apply security measures to mitigate the risks.
- DevSecOps uses automated security testing tools such as static code analysis and vulnerability scanners to identify security issues before the code is deployed to the production environment.

## Differences between DevOps and DevSecOps
The main difference between DevOps and DevSecOps is that the latter includes security as an integral part of the software development process, whereas DevOps focuses primarily on collaboration and automation between software developers and IT operations teams. DevSecOps also requires a different mindset, with a focus on proactive security measures and risk management, rather than reactive responses to security threats.

| DevOps | DevSecOps |
| ------ | --------- |
| Emphasis on collaboration, communication, and automation between software developers and IT operations teams. | Integrates security practices and tools into the DevOps process. |
| Aims to streamline the software development process and improve the speed and quality of software delivery. | Aims to ensure that security is not an afterthought, but rather a key part of the development process from the very beginning. |
| Focuses on continuous integration and delivery. | Requires a different mindset, with a focus on proactive security measures and risk management. |

## Conclusion
In conclusion, while DevOps and DevSecOps share some similarities, they are distinct approaches to software development and delivery. DevOps focuses on collaboration, communication, and automation between software developers and IT operations teams, while DevSecOps incorporates security into the process from the very beginning. By understanding the differences between the two approaches, organizations can choose the one that best meets their needs and goals.
